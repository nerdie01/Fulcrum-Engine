# Fulcrum-Engine

**Fulcrum** is a 3D rendering engine. It is a unique piece of software that can't be neatly categorized as a game engine, rendering tool, or physics engine. Users install plugins known as **arms** to customize Fulcrum for their use - some of which are created by me, others which are created by the community. Different combinations of arms can make Fulcrum operate differently - a raytraced lighting arm and animation arm may be good for rendering, a physics arm makes for a good physics engine, and an input arm and lighting arm can be used to turn Fulcrum into a game engine.

**Build instructions coming soon :)**
